# anonymise_example.toml — template for PDF anonymisation config.
#
# HOW TO USE
# ----------
# 1. Copy this file to anonymise.toml in the same directory.
# 2. Replace every LEFT-HAND value with the real text as it appears in your
#    PDF (copy-paste from the PDF to be exact).
# 3. Replace every RIGHT-HAND value with the dummy text you want rendered
#    in its place.
# 4. Keep anonymise.toml out of source control — it is git-ignored.
#
# ORDERING RULES
# --------------
# Within each section, entries are applied top-to-bottom.
# Always place LONGER / MORE SPECIFIC strings BEFORE shorter fragments.
# Example: list "John William Surname" before "Surname" to avoid the
# fragment match firing first and corrupting the full-name replacement.
#
# SECTIONS
# --------
# [global_replacements]  — applied on every page, entire page area.
#   Use for names, name fragments, account numbers, card numbers, IBAN,
#   and any value that is unique enough not to collide with merchant text.
#
# [address_replacements] — applied on PAGE 1 ONLY, within the personal
#   address block in the top-left of the page.
#   Use for address lines, city names, and postcodes that also appear
#   as merchant/location names inside transaction descriptions.
